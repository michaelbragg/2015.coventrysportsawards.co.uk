We&rsquo;re delighted to be associated with the Coventry and Warwickshire Sports Awards again this year. Sport and Industry often share common goals, and can both be highly competitive, so we feel this is a great match for our business. As our organisation grows in Coventry and throughout the Midlands, we hope to continue to develop our involvement with, and support of the local community. As an innovative Managed Print Services and Document Solutions specialist, we&rsquo;re Ricoh&rsquo;s number one supplier in Europe, and feel a close affinity to Coventry, Warwickshire and the surrounding area.
