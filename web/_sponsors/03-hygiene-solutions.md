Hygiene Solutions are proud to be associated with the Coventry and Warwickshire Sports Awards. Often sporting successes in Coventry and Warwickshire aren&rsquo;t trumpeted enough and we think it high time that balance is redressed. We have chosen to support the Professional Sportswoman of the Year Award in order to help promote the great job women do in the local sporting arena.

We are a well-established, specialist washroom service provider that concentrates on giving an excellent, professional service and using only the best hygiene products. Our current client base covers a range of industries from Metropolitan borough councils to sports stadiums, from nursery schools to shopping centres and both large and small businesses.

We take pride in our business and we take pride in yours.
