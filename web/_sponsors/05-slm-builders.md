SLM Building Contractors are incredibly proud to be associated with such a prestigious event and to support the Amateur Sportsman of the Year Award at the second annual Coventry &amp; Warwickshire Sports Awards.
SLM have seen success over the last decade working on major projects with Local Authorities, Housing Associations and developers and have enormous experience in a number of areas, including, new build developments and commercial projects.

Our sponsorship of the Amateur Sportsman of the Year Award is driven by our desire to recognise the success of those in the Warwickshire who compete solely for the love of their chosen sport. Often that is reward enough for amateur sportspeople but we think it important that we do our bit to support their efforts and celebrate their achievements.
