Inspirational Magazine is delighted to be involved with the Coventry and Warwickshire Sports Awards again.Â We are dedicated to finding the very best that Warwickshire has to offer and these awards are another perfect opportunity to do so. The region is so diverse and there are so many examples of true sporting excellence, both professional and amateur, that we see it time and again in teams, individuals and, of course, in all those people who work so hard behind the scenes.

Our sponsorship of the Professional Young Sportsperson of the Year Award is driven by our desire to recognise those who represent the future of sport in Coventry and Warwickshire.

They have shown incredible commitment to their chosen field at a time in their lives when there are so many distractions. That kind of discipline is not only admirable but also something Inspirational Magazine wants to encourage and celebrate.
