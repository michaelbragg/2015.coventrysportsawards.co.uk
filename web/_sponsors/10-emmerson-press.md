Emmersons are delighted to be sponsoring the &lsquo;Club of the Year&rsquo; award - recognising the role Clubs play in bringing communities together to foster and showcase the sporting heritage and prowess that the region has to offer. Emmersons feel privileged to participate in an event that both celebrates the passion of sport found within clubs as well as providing a platform to encourage and recognise sporting excellence.

Emmersons deliver print solutions within the region and so understand the importance of focus, determination, hard work and the willingness to go the extra mile - Emmersons are proud to support this award.
