Absolute HR Solutions and Absolute Recruitment Service Ltd are honoured to lend our support to the second Coventry and Warwickshire Sports Awards. It is our aim to help small and medium sized businesses maximise the performance of their employees, so, when we look at those who succeed in sport, it is no surprise to us that they often share many of the qualities we seek to promote through our work. By celebrating the achievements of junior sportspeople we hope to further endorse those qualities and inspire people to copy their tenacity, commitment, teamwork and motivation and put it to use in everything they do.
