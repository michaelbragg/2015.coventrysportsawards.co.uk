We are delighted to be involved with the Coventry and Warwickshire Sports Awards and welcome the opportunity to support the region&rsquo;s fantastic sporting community. We have a wealth of well-known sports personalities in the area, as well as a great selection of amateur clubs and teams and some hugely talented young people, so the awards are the perfect way to recognize those who excel at what they do.

Sport is such a great way to unite any size of community and the region has a great sporting legacy, across a range of different disciplines. We hope to see even more of our sports stars recognized on a national and international stage in the future and the Coventry Sports Awards promise to be the region&rsquo;s most prestigious recognition of the region&rsquo;s wealth of talent.
