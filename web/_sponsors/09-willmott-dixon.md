Willmott Dixon is enormously proud to support the Coventry &amp; Warwickshire Sports Awards and to sponsor the Under 19/School Team of the Year Award. We understand the important role that sport plays in young people&rsquo;s lives &emdash; from keeping fit and learning about team work, to developing discipline and competitiveness, sport helps young people grow and achieve amazing things. That is something we want to celebrate.

Willmott Dixon is firmly committed to developing young people in our own way. Since our people are our greatest asset, we are very pleased that over a third of our employees have taken part in our comprehensive apprenticeship, management and leadership development programmes and that helps us sustain a challenged and contented workforce.
