At Dallas Burston Polo Club, we are firmly committed to the values of integrity, respect for others, loyalty, trust, courage and self-discipline. The Lifetime Achievement Award celebrates individuals who have embodied these ideals over a number of years, not just as an instructor but as a coach, mentor and role model, often compromising many other personal commitments. DBPC is pleased to sponsor the award in appreciation of their tireless contribution to the local sporting community.
